        <p>Fruit juice is very good for health because it provides vitamin and nutrition that build body. Since the present market is generally covered by orange, apple, strawberry, grape juice and our new product water melon juice is full of nutrition we want to present it with nice flavors, nice containers and with a real taste at reasonable price.</p>

        <p>A snack is a small portion of food generally eaten between meals.[1] Snacks come in a variety of forms including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made from fresh ingredients at home.

            Traditionally, snacks are prepared from ingredients commonly available at home without a great deal of preparation. Often cold cuts, fruits, leftovers, nuts, sandwiches, and sweets are used as snacks. With the spread of convenience stores, packaged snack foods became a significant business</p>

     <p>Chocolate is a food made from cacao beans. It is used in many desserts like pudding, cakes, candy, ice cream, and Easter eggs. It can be in a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate. Commercial chocolate has sugar and sometimes milk added. It has a melting point of about 32 °C (90 °F).

        Dark chocolate has less sugar, and a more bitter taste. It was originally used to make drinking chocolate. Chocolate has been around the world since the time of the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztecs.</p>
